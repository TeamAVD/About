### Who We Are
We're a small Team that were founded in late 2023 by Matt (AKA AVD Dev), a 21 year old who resides in the UK. AetherVoid Developments isn't a global or well known Organisation yet, but We hope to reach that status in the future!

***Our Members:***
- Matt, 21 (AKA AVD Dev): Founder and CEO of AetherVoid Developments.
- Sarah, 24 (AKA Ghosty): COO of AetherVoid Developments.
- Ellie, 22 (AKA Reapzy): Project Overseer and lead management.
- Gemma, 28 (AKA AOD): Advertisement, promotion and analytics management.
- Marcus, 34: Requested to have little information stated.

We're aware that using aliases is unprofessional. We do this to remain somewhat anonymous and protect Our privacy. We live in a digital age where anything can be found over the Internet and thus, try to avoid that.

### What We Do
We cover a quire a few niche categories of services. This means that We focus on multiple things rather than one or two. The aim of Our Organisation is to house relative services and information all in one place. Making it easy to find and come back to.

- Private investigating: Via OSINT methods or publicly (We do live research on "Targets").
- Social media marketing (SMM) and online profile growth: We offer a wide range of services to help boost Your online status via Bots or organic methods.
- Developments services: We can build unique, modern and clean websites, cross platform apps, games and even back-end infrastructure.
- Image and video design / editing: We can create beautifully designed logos, banners, covers as well as edit Your videos to perfection.
- Data removal and cleansing: Almost every website or app You use collects some sort of information on You, even if it's just device fingerprinting. We can go through this data and get it removed or at the very least reduced, making Your online identity that much cleaner.
- App / game modification and cracking: Looking for a specific app or game to suit Your needs but it requires payment? You can submit a request and We'll make sure You get what You want for free! We can also modify the app or game in question and implement new features or simply enhance existing features.

We also offer a few other services like creating / modifying an operating system, cheap subscriptions for services and more!
